## Inline MInishop

This little project is just to put into practice the programming courses about Laravel and Vuejs that I'm doing, and as I consider that learning about github is also important, it's at the order in the unlikely case that someone will use it for something!
In the Master origin brand I leave it until login register working, completely as an ASP, with a menu on the left also created as a component, I have not made much emphasis on the aesthetic part, as it is one of my weak points, I have left this for later so everything looks like it comes by default!

Ambiente de desarrollo:
apache
mysql
php. 7.2
Laravel 7.2
vuejs 2.0
